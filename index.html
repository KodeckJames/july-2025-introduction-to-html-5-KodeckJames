                <h3>Essential Steps for Beginners</h3>
                <p>Starting your sustainable garden journey requires understanding your local environment and choosing the right approach for your space.</p>
                
                <h4>1. Assess Your Growing Space</h4>
                <p>Before planting, evaluate your garden's sunlight exposure, soil type, and drainage conditions. This knowledge helps you select appropriate plants and plan your layout effectively.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Test and Improve Your Soil</h4>
                <p>Healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable gardening. Test your soil's pH and nutrient levels, then enhance it naturally with compost and organic matter.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Choose Native and Adapted Plants</h4>
                <p>Native plants require less water, fertilizer, and pest control because they're naturally suited to your local climate and soil conditions.</p>

                <h3>Composting for Garden Health</h3>
                <p>Composting transforms kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment, reducing waste while feeding your plants naturally.</p>

                <p>Efficient water use is crucial for sustainable gardening. These techniques help conserve water while keeping plants healthy.</p>
                
                <h4>Mulching Benefits</h4>

                <h4>Rainwater Harvesting</h4>
                <p>Collecting rainwater in barrels or cisterns provides free irrigation water and reduces runoff from your property.</p>

                <h3>Organic Pest Management</h3>
                <p>Control garden pests naturally without harmful chemicals that can damage beneficial insects and soil organisms.</p>
                
                <h4>Companion Planting</h4>
                <p>Strategic plant combinations can naturally repel pests and attract beneficial insects. For example, marigolds deter many common garden pests when planted near vegetables.</p>
                
                <h4>Encouraging Beneficial Insects</h4>
                <p>Create habitat for helpful insects like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps by planting diverse flowering plants and providing shelter.</p>
